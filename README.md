# Global FWI utils

Some of the LASIF functionalities are becoming more and more difficult to maintain. Therefore, it makes sense to move some of the utilities, like plotting-functions, outside of LASIF. This repository runs with minimal requirements.

Set up a new conda - environment.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

```
conda activate lasif-utils 
```

And we are ready to go.

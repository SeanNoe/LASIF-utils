# Global FWI utils

Some of the LASIF functionalities are becoming more and more difficult to maintain. Therefore, it makes sense to move some of the utilities, like plotting-functions, outside of LASIF. This repositories should run on minimal requirements.

`conda create -n lasif-utils python matplotlib numpy scipy cartopy`

`conda activate lasif-utils `

And we are ready to go.
